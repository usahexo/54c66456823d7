What are the seven themes?
The seven themes of literature are according to Kenneth Burke, sympathy, identification, evaluation, division, opposition, and communion. 
Each one of these helps to create meaning in literature and support the main theme. Let's discuss each one in more detail. 

Sympathy is when the reader feels pity or concern for the characters in a work. Identification is when the reader blurry the lines between themselves and the character in order to understand them better. Evaluation is judgment rendered by the reader about the worth of a particular character or action. Division is analyzing a text into smaller pieces in order to understand it better. Opposition is looking at different sides of an argument to gain a deeper understanding. And communion is when the reader connects with the work on a personal level. 

All of these help to create a well-rounded reading experience that allows readers to connect with literature on different levels. Each theme works together with all of the others to produce a powerful effect. These themes are important because they help make literature more than just words on a page – they help readers feel empathy and connection with characters, providing them with an unforgettable experience.

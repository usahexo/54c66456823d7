#  Eagle Mountain Casino Hosts Second Survivor Game

The Eagle Mountain Casino hosted its second Survivor Game on Saturday, May 12. The event was open to the public and drew a large crowd of people who wanted to test their skills at outlasting in the wilderness.

The game began with eighteen players, who were all randomly divided into two tribes. The tribes then had to compete in a series of challenges in order to win rewards and immunity. In the end, only one player remained: Tony from the yellow tribe.

Tony was declared the winner of the game and was presented with a $1,000 prize. He said that he planned to use the money to help his family pay for their upcoming vacation. "I'm really happy that I won," Tony said. "This is a great experience and I'm glad that I was able to come out on top."

The Eagle Mountain Casino would like to thank everyone who participated in the Survivor Game. We hope you had as much fun as we did!

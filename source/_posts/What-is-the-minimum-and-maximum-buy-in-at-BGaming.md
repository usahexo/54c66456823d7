#  What are the rake rates at BGaming?

BGaming offers some of the highest rake rates in the online poker industry. All tables, excluding heads-up tables, are charged a flat rake rate of 5%. In addition, for each $0.10 in the pot at a capped table, BGaming charges an additional $0.01 in rake. For example, if the pot reaches $30.00 at a capped table, BGaming would charge an additional $0.30 in rake, for a total rake of $0.35.

Heads-up tables are charged a slightly higher rake rate of 6%. In addition, for each $0.15 in the pot at a capped table, BGaming charges an additional $0.02 in rake. For example, if the pot reaches $45.00 at a capped table, BGaming would charge an additional $0.90 in rake, for a total rake of $1.05.

Rake is paid out to the winning player at each hand according to the following payout schedule:

1-2 players: 80% / 20%
3-4 players: 60% / 30% / 10%
5-6 players: 50% / 30% / 20% / 10%
7-8 players: 40% / 30% / 25% / 10%

#  What is the average amount of hands you can expect to play per hour?

The average number of hands an individual can play per hour varies based on the limits of the game, the aggressiveness of the player, and a variety of other factors. Generally speaking though, most poker players can expect to play around sixty to eighty hands per hour at lower limits and up to one hundred hands per hour at higher limits.

# How does the number of hands played vary based on limit?

As one might expect, the number of hands that can be played in an hour varies drastically based on the limit being played. At lower levels, where the stakes are smaller, players will typically play fewer hands per hour. This is due primarily to two factors: there is less money on the line per hand and players are typically less aggressive at these limits. Conversely, at higher levels where the stakes are larger, players will often play more hands per hour as they look to maximize their profits. Additionally, many high-stakes games are played “live” with relatively few hands being dealt in comparison to online games.

# How does the number of hands played vary based on aggressiveness?

The aggressiveness of a player also has a significant impact on how many hands they will play in an hour. More aggressive players will typically play more hands than those who are less aggressive. This is primarily due to the fact that more aggressive players are looking to take control of the table by playing more aggressively themselves and punishing their opponents for making mistakes. Conversely, passive players will usually play fewer hands as they try to minimize their losses and wait for better opportunities.

#  What are the starting blinds and antes at BGaming?

BGaming offers a variety of different poker games with varying blind levels and antes. The starting blinds and antes at BGaming depend on the game being played.

Some of the most popular BGaming poker games include Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and 7-Card Stud. For Texas Hold’em, the starting blinds are typically $0.10/$0.25, but can go as high as $100/$200. For Omaha, the starting blinds are typically $0.05/$0.10, but can go as high as $25/$50. For 7-Card Stud, the starting blinds are typically $0.10/$0.20, but can go as high as $10/$20.

The antes at BGaming also vary depending on the game being played. However, they typically start at around 1% of the big blind amount for each game type. So, for example, in a Texas Hold’em game with a $1/2 blind level, the ante would be $0.02 per hand dealt.

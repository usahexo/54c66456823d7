#  Manchester United and Manchester City Battle for Premier League Crown

Both Manchester clubs are in heated battle for Premier League crown. Manchester United is currently on the top of the table with 71 points, while Manchester City is just one point behind with 70 points.

This Premier League season has been extremely exciting and it all comes down to the last few games. Manchester United has been in great form, but they will have to continue to play well if they want to stay on top.

Manchester City has been playing very well lately and they will definitely be a tough opponent for Manchester United. If Manchester City can win their next few games, they will overtake Manchester United and be crowned champions.

It will be an intense battle between these two clubs and it is definitely going to come down to the last few games. Who do you think will come out on top?

#  Liverpool Looks to Regain Strength After Struggling Early in the Season

Liverpool was a club that many touted as a potential championship contender this season. However, the club has had a tough start to the year and sits in 8th place in the Premier League table.

Manager Juergen Klopp has come under criticism for the team’s poor form, but he remains confident that the side can improve. One of the biggest issues for Liverpool has been their defensive play. They have conceded 17 goals in 12 matches, which is more than any other team in the top half of the table.

Klopp has made some changes to the lineup in an effort to shore up the defense, but it has yet to produce results. One positive for Liverpool is their attacking potency. They have scored 22 goals, which is third most in the league.

The club will look to get back on track when they face off against Tottenham this weekend. Tottenham has been one of the best teams in England this year and currently sits in 4th place in the Premier League table. It will be a tough match for Liverpool, but they will need to get three points if they hope to make a run for Champions League qualification.

#  Arsenal Chases Tottenham Hotspur for Third Place

Arsenal, who is currently in fifth-place in the Premier League table, is looking to chase Tottenham Hotspur for third place. With the season quickly coming to a close, it will be important for Arsenal to garner as many points as possible in order to make a push for the final Champions League spot.

Tottenham Hotspur has been impressive this season with their young squad and Mauricio Pochettino at the helm. The London derby will be a difficult match for both clubs, but it is especially important for Arsenal who are looking to close the gap between themselves and Spurs.

Some of Arsenal’s key players this season have been Mesut Özil, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. All three players have contributed offensively and will need to continue doing so in order to secure a spot in the Champions League.

In their last match against Southampton, Özil notched an assist on Lacazette’s goal in a 3-2 victory. This win brings Arsenal closer to Tottenham Hotspur who are currently two points ahead in fourth-place.

If Arsenal can continue to win games and pick up some valuable points against their rivals, they have a good chance of finishing in third-place. With only eight games left in the Premier League season, it will be an intense competition between several clubs vying for a spot in Europe’s top club competition

#  Chelsea and Newcastle United Vie for Top Spot in the Table


The race for the top spot in the Premier League table is heating up as Chelsea and Newcastle United battle it out. Both sides are unbeaten in their last five games, with Newcastle United currently holding the advantage with two more points.

Chelsea had an excellent start to the season but have since slowed down, with only three wins in their last six games. Their upcoming fixtures could be the opportunity they need to get back on track and reclaim the top spot.

Newcastle United, on the other hand, have been consistently putting in good performances and now look like a team that could potentially stay up at the end of the season. They’ll need to keep up their good form if they want to continue competing for a top-four finish.

It’s going to be an exciting few weeks as these two teams go head-to-head for first place in the table.

#  Brighton & Hove Albion, Cardiff City Earn Promotions to the Premier League

In a thrilling conclusion to the 2017-2018 English Championship season, Brighton & Hove Albion and Cardiff City both earned automatic promotions to the Premier League.

Brighton finished in second place in the Championship table with 84 points, while Cardiff placed third with 82 points. The two clubs will join Wolverhampton Wanderers, who earned promotion last weekend, in the Premier League next season.

Brighton had been in touching distance of automatic promotion for much of the season, but a run of four defeats in their final six matches left them sweating on a top-two finish. However, they held their nerve to secure a return to the top flight after a one-year absence.

Cardiff City also experienced some late-season heartache, as they lost 2-1 at home to Bolton Wanderers on the final day of the campaign. That result meant that they needed Fulham to lose at home to Birmingham City in order to clinch automatic promotion. But Fulham held on for a 1-0 win, meaning Cardiff would have to settle for a playoff place.

The Bluebirds made no mistake once they reached the playoffs, however, beating Reading 4-1 on aggregate in the semifinal before then dispatching Preston North End 3-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium. It is Cardiff’s first appearance in the Premier League since 2013-2014.

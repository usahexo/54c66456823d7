#  Milwaukee Bucks Strike Deal with Casino Dealers Union

The Milwaukee Bucks announced Wednesday that they had reached a tentative labor agreement with their unionized casino dealers.

The three-year agreement is subject to ratification by the membership of United Auto Workers Local 833, who represents the Bucks’ dealers.

Details of the agreement were not released, but both sides are calling it a “win-win.”

“We are very pleased to have come to an agreement with our casino dealers,” said Bucks president Peter Feigin.

“This deal allows us to maintain the high standards of customer service that our fans have come to expect, while also providing our dealers with good wages and benefits. We look forward to working together in a productive and positive manner going forward.”

Union spokesman Bob Schultz echoed Feigin’s sentiments, calling the agreement “a great victory for our dealers and their families.”

The tentative agreement comes as something of a surprise, given the acrimonious relationship that developed between the Bucks and their dealers last season. In February, the Bucks locked out the unionized dealers after negotiations over a new contract broke down.

The lockout lasted for more than two months, during which time the team was forced to rely on nonunionized replacements. The ordeal was a public relations disaster for the Bucks, and led many observers to question whether the team could survive in Milwaukee without its casino dealers.

It now appears that those questions have been answered. The new agreement is not only good news for the dealers, but also for the Bucks, who can now move on from last season’s fiasco and focus on rebuilding their brand in Milwaukee.

#  Milwaukee Bucks in Negotiations with Casino Dealers Union

The Milwaukee Bucks are in negotiations with the union representing their casino dealers to reach a new deal. The previous agreement expired on September 30th, and the two sides have been unable to come to an agreement.

Under the old deal, casino dealers earned an hourly wage of $11.50 plus tips. The proposed new deal would increase their hourly wage to $12.50, with annual raises of 50 cents until it reaches $15 in 2022. In addition, the new deal would include a one-time ratification bonus of $750.

The union is pushing for a higher wage, while the Bucks argue that the current wage is fair given the unpredictable nature of tips. They also expressed concern that a higher wage would lead to fewer jobs being offered at the casino.

Both sides remain hopeful that they can reach a new deal before the current one expires on October 31st.

The Milwaukee Bucks have reached a tentative agreement with unionized casino dealers, averting a potential lockout.

The deal includes wage increases and more flexible work schedules, as well as promises from the Bucks to not outsource any jobs to other casinos.

"We're very happy to have reached this agreement," said Bucks president Peter Feigin. "Our dealers are an important part of our team and we're glad to be able to offer them competitive wages and working conditions."

Union president Rich Dworsky praised the Bucks for their willingness to negotiate in good faith.

"This is a fair agreement that benefits both the dealers and the Bucks," Dworsky said. "We're looking forward to getting back to work and helping the Bucks make a run at the championship."

#  Milwaukee Bucks, casino dealers reach tentative deal

The Milwaukee Bucks and the casino dealers reached a tentative agreement after days of negotiations. The tentative deal includes pay raises for the dealers and more hiring.

The Bucks organization has been under scrutiny lately due to their poor play on the court. However, this tentative deal shows that they are committed to their employees off the court as well.

Under the tentative deal, casino dealers would see a pay raise of $2 per hour starting in 2020. In 2021, they would see another pay raise of $1 per hour. This would bring the starting salary for a casino dealer in Milwaukee to $15 per hour.

In addition, the Bucks have agreed to hire more casino dealers. There is currently a shortage of dealers in Milwaukee, so this will help remedy that issue.

Both the Bucks and the casino dealers seem happy with this tentative deal. It is a win-win for both parties involved. The Bucks get to show their commitment to their employees, and the casino dealers get a pay raise and more job opportunities.

#  Milwaukee Bucks, casino dealers reach deal

The Milwaukee Bucks and casino dealers have reached a new tentative deal that would keep the dealers working during the NBA playoffs. The new deal comes after the previous one expired on Sunday.

The old contract allowed the casino dealers to work during the regular season, but they were not allowed to work during the playoffs. This new deal would keep them working throughout the playoffs.

In order to come to this agreement, both sides had to make some compromises. The Bucks had asked for a cap on the number of dealers who could work during the playoffs, while the dealers demanded that they be able to work all playoff games.

In the end, a compromise was reached that will allow between 40 and 50 dealers to work each game. This will ensure that there are enough dealers available, but also won’t cause too many delays in getting people their food and drinks.

This new deal is good news for both the Bucks and the casino dealers. The Bucks get to keep their fans happy by having food and drink available throughout the game, and the casino dealers get to keep their jobs and continue making money.

Are you looking for ways to beat the Cloynes gambling game at Palm Casino? You’re in luck! We’ve got the inside scoop on how to win big.

First, familiarize yourself with the basic rules of the game. Cloynes is a three-card game, and the aim is to score as close to 21 as possible without going over. The ace is worth 1 point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.

Your hand will be scored according to these values: first card - rightmost digit of sum of second and third card; second card - leftmost digit of sum of second and third card; third card - middle digit of sum of second and third card. For example, if your hand is 5, 7, King: first card - 5 (rightmost digit), second card - 7 (leftmost), third card - King (middle).

Now that you know the basics, here are our top tips for beating Cloynes:

3. Know your odds. The odds of getting any particular hand vary depending on the number of players in the game – so be sure to do your research before playing!

# First Cruise Ship With A Many Position Machine 

The first cruise ship with a many position machine was built in 1955. The vessel had a large number of hydraulic powered posts, which could be controlled from the bridge to move items around the deck. This allowed the crew to quickly and easily reposition cargo and supplies, without having to call on shore assistance.

The many position machine was an instant success, and quickly became standard equipment on all cruise ships. It made life much easier for the crew, who were now able to handle all of the cargo operations themselves. This saved time and money, and made for a more efficient ship operation.

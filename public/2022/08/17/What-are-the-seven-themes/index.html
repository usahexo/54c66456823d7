        <h1 id="What-are-the-seven-themes"><a href="#What-are-the-seven-themes" class="headerlink" title="What are the seven themes?"></a>What are the seven themes?</h1><p>What are the seven themes?<br>The seven themes of literature are according to Kenneth Burke, sympathy, identification, evaluation, division, opposition, and communion.<br>Each one of these helps to create meaning in literature and support the main theme. Let’s discuss each one in more detail. </p>
<p>Sympathy is when the reader feels pity or concern for the characters in a work. Identification is when the reader blurry the lines between themselves and the character in order to understand them better. Evaluation is judgment rendered by the reader about the worth of a particular character or action. Division is analyzing a text into smaller pieces in order to understand it better. Opposition is looking at different sides of an argument to gain a deeper understanding. And communion is when the reader connects with the work on a personal level. </p>
<p>All of these help to create a well-rounded reading experience that allows readers to connect with literature on different levels. Each theme works together with all of the others to produce a powerful effect. These themes are important because they help make literature more than just words on a page – they help readers feel empathy and connection with characters, providing them with an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>Happiness is different for each person, but there are some general things that make most people happy. According to a study by the University of Cambridge, these include relationships, health, achievement, financial security and how we spend our time.</p>
<p>Most people want to be happy and will go out of their way to achieve it. However, happiness is not something that can be pursued directly – it’s a result of living a meaningful life. Trying to be happy often leads to stress and can actually have the opposite effect. So, what should you do if you want to be happy?</p>

</li>
<li><p>Live mindfully: Be present in the moment and appreciate what you have. this will help you savour the good moments in life and reduce stress levels</p>

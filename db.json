It has a coast on the Atlantic Ocean and is bordered by Namibia to the south, Zambia to the east, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north. Angola is the seventh-largest country in Africa, with a total area of 1,246,700 square kilometers.\n\nThe capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda. Other major cities include Huambo, Lobito, Benguela, and Lubango.\n\nAngola has a population of approximately 27 million people. The majority of the population lives in rural areas, and about 80 percent depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Portuguese is the official language of Angola, and over 99 percent of the population identifies as Roman Catholic.\n\nAfter gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola endured a brutal civil war that lasted until 2002. Since then, the country has made significant strides in rebuilding its infrastructure and economy. However, much work remains to be done in terms of poverty reduction and improving healthcare and education outcomes.\n\n# Angola's History\n\nAngola is located on Africa's southwestern coast and is bordered by Namibia to the south, Zambia to the east, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the north. The name \"Angola\" traces back to the 16th century when Portuguese traders first visited the region. At that time, it was known as Ndongo and was ruled by a dynasty of warrior kings known as the Imbangala.\n\nPortugal began colonizing Angola in the early 16th century, and by 1900 it had become one of Portugal's most important overseas possessions. In 1961, Angola gained its independence from Portugal following a long struggle for liberation. However, this was only the beginning of years of strife and conflict.\n\nFrom 1975-2002, Angola was plagued by a brutal civil war that left over 500,000 people dead. The conflict was fueled by sectarian violence between rival political factions as well as competing economic interests among different groups within society. A peace agreement was reached in 2002 however sporadic outbreaks of violence continue to occur.\n\nSince 2004 Angola has been making significant strides in rebuilding its infrastructure and economy with assistance from multilateral organizations such as OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and World Bank . While much progress has been made there remain significant challenges including reducing poverty levels , improving healthcare outcomes , and increasing access to education .\n\n#  What is Hegel?\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German philosopher who lived from 1770 to 1831. He is considered one of the most important philosophers of the 1800s, and his philosophy continues to be studied and debated to this day.\n\nHegel's philosophy is complex, but can be broadly summarized as advocating for the understanding of reality as a dynamic process. He believed that in order to understand reality, we must consider it not as individual objects or events, but in terms of their relationships with other objects and events.\n\nIn addition to his philosophical theories, Hegel also wrote extensively about history and politics. He is considered one of the fathers of modern Germany, and his ideas about the need for a strong central government have been highly influential throughout Europe.\n\n#  What does Hegel mean?\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German philosopher who lived during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He wrote extensively on a variety of topics, but is most renowned for his philosophy, which focused on the relationship between reason and history.\n\nHegel's work has been immensely influential, and he is considered one of the most important philosophers of all time. His thought is still studied and debated by philosophers and thinkers all over the world, more than 200 years after his death.\n\nSo what exactly did Hegel mean? In a nutshell, Hegel believed that human history progressed in a linear fashion, with each stage representing an advance in reason or consciousness. He also believed that progress was made through dialectical reasoning – that is, by reconciling opposites.\n\nFor Hegel, philosophy was the ultimate tool for understanding the world and making progress. He saw it as a way of apprehending reality as it truly is, as opposed to how it appears to be. This approach was known as phenomenology.\n\nHegel's philosophy has been criticised by many people over the years. Some see it as overly optimistic and simplistic, while others find its abstractions difficult to understand. However, there is no doubt that Hegel's work has had a major impact on modern thought, and that his ideas continue to be studied and debated to this day.\n\n#  How do you pronounce Hegel?\n\nThe philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel is a notoriously difficult name to pronounce for English speakers. There is no single correct way to say it; some people say “heal-gell”, others say “hay-gel”.\n\nHegel was born in 1770 in Germany. He studied philosophy at the University of Jena, and taught at various universities in Germany before moving to Berlin in 1816, where he served as the head of the philosophy department at the University of Berlin.\n\nHegel is best known for his philosophical system, which attempted to provide a comprehensive account of reality and human experience. His ideas have been highly influential on subsequent philosophers, and continue to be debated and discussed today.","source":"_posts/What-is-StarVegas.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is StarVegas\ndate: 2022-09-22 21:00:55\ncategories:\n- Starvegas\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is StarVegas?\n\nStarVegas is an online casino and gaming platform that offers players a wide range of games to choose from.

It has a coast on the Atlantic Ocean and is bordered by Namibia to the south, Zambia to the east, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north. Angola is the seventh-largest country in Africa, with a total area of 1,246,700 square kilometers.</p>\n<p>The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda. Other major cities include Huambo, Lobito, Benguela, and Lubango.</p>\n<p>Angola has a population of approximately 27 million people. The majority of the population lives in rural areas, and about 80 percent depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Portuguese is the official language of Angola, and over 99 percent of the population identifies as Roman Catholic.</p>\n<p>After gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola endured a brutal civil war that lasted until 2002. Since then, the country has made significant strides in rebuilding its infrastructure and economy. However, much work remains to be done in terms of poverty reduction and improving healthcare and education outcomes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Angola’s-History\"><a href=\"#Angola’s-History\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Angola’s History\"></a>Angola’s History</h1><p>Angola is located on Africa’s southwestern coast and is bordered by Namibia to the south, Zambia to the east, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the north. The name “Angola” traces back to the 16th century when Portuguese traders first visited the region. At that time, it was known as Ndongo and was ruled by a dynasty of warrior kings known as the Imbangala.</p>\n<p>Portugal began colonizing Angola in the early 16th century, and by 1900 it had become one of Portugal’s most important overseas possessions. In 1961, Angola gained its independence from Portugal following a long struggle for liberation. However, this was only the beginning of years of strife and conflict.</p>\n<p>From 1975-2002, Angola was plagued by a brutal civil war that left over 500,000 people dead. The conflict was fueled by sectarian violence between rival political factions as well as competing economic interests among different groups within society. A peace agreement was reached in 2002 however sporadic outbreaks of violence continue to occur.</p>\n<p>Since 2004 Angola has been making significant strides in rebuilding its infrastructure and economy with assistance from multilateral organizations such as OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and World Bank . While much progress has been made there remain significant challenges including reducing poverty levels , improving healthcare outcomes , and increasing access to education .</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-is-Hegel\"><a href=\"#What-is-Hegel\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is Hegel?\"></a>What is Hegel?</h1><p>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German philosopher who lived from 1770 to 1831. He is considered one of the most important philosophers of the 1800s, and his philosophy continues to be studied and debated to this day.</p>\n<p>Hegel’s philosophy is complex, but can be broadly summarized as advocating for the understanding of reality as a dynamic process. He believed that in order to understand reality, we must consider it not as individual objects or events, but in terms of their relationships with other objects and events.</p>\n<p>In addition to his philosophical theories, Hegel also wrote extensively about history and politics. He is considered one of the fathers of modern Germany, and his ideas about the need for a strong central government have been highly influential throughout Europe.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-does-Hegel-mean\"><a href=\"#What-does-Hegel-mean\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What does Hegel mean?\"></a>What does Hegel mean?</h1><p>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German philosopher who lived during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He wrote extensively on a variety of topics, but is most renowned for his philosophy, which focused on the relationship between reason and history.</p>\n<p>Hegel’s work has been immensely influential, and he is considered one of the most important philosophers of all time. His thought is still studied and debated by philosophers and thinkers all over the world, more than 200 years after his death.</p>\n<p>So what exactly did Hegel mean? In a nutshell, Hegel believed that human history progressed in a linear fashion, with each stage representing an advance in reason or consciousness. He also believed that progress was made through dialectical reasoning – that is, by reconciling opposites.</p>\n<p>For Hegel, philosophy was the ultimate tool for understanding the world and making progress.

So whether you want to bet big or small, BGaming has you covered!\n\n#  What are the rake rates at BGaming?\n\nBGaming offers some of the highest rake rates in the online poker industry. All tables, excluding heads-up tables, are charged a flat rake rate of 5%. In addition, for each $0.10 in the pot at a capped table, BGaming charges an additional $0.01 in rake. For example, if the pot reaches $30.00 at a capped table, BGaming would charge an additional $0.30 in rake, for a total rake of $0.35.\n\nHeads-up tables are charged a slightly higher rake rate of 6%. In addition, for each $0.15 in the pot at a capped table, BGaming charges an additional $0.02 in rake. For example, if the pot reaches $45.00 at a capped table, BGaming would charge an additional $0.90 in rake, for a total rake of $1.05.\n\nRake is paid out to the winning player at each hand according to the following payout schedule:\n\n1-2 players: 80% / 20%\n3-4 players: 60% / 30% / 10%\n5-6 players: 50% / 30% / 20% / 10%\n7-8 players: 40% / 30% / 25% / 10%\n\n#  What is the average amount of hands you can expect to play per hour?\n\nThe average number of hands an individual can play per hour varies based on the limits of the game, the aggressiveness of the player, and a variety of other factors. Generally speaking though, most poker players can expect to play around sixty to eighty hands per hour at lower limits and up to one hundred hands per hour at higher limits.\n\n# How does the number of hands played vary based on limit?\n\nAs one might expect, the number of hands that can be played in an hour varies drastically based on the limit being played. At lower levels, where the stakes are smaller, players will typically play fewer hands per hour. This is due primarily to two factors: there is less money on the line per hand and players are typically less aggressive at these limits. Conversely, at higher levels where the stakes are larger, players will often play more hands per hour as they look to maximize their profits. Additionally, many high-stakes games are played “live” with relatively few hands being dealt in comparison to online games.\n\n# How does the number of hands played vary based on aggressiveness?\n\nThe aggressiveness of a player also has a significant impact on how many hands they will play in an hour. More aggressive players will typically play more hands than those who are less aggressive. This is primarily due to the fact that more aggressive players are looking to take control of the table by playing more aggressively themselves and punishing their opponents for making mistakes. Conversely, passive players will usually play fewer hands as they try to minimize their losses and wait for better opportunities.\n\n#  What are the starting blinds and antes at BGaming?\n\nBGaming offers a variety of different poker games with varying blind levels and antes. The starting blinds and antes at BGaming depend on the game being played.\n\nSome of the most popular BGaming poker games include Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and 7-Card Stud. For Texas Hold’em, the starting blinds are typically $0.10/$0.25, but can go as high as $100/$200. For Omaha, the starting blinds are typically $0.05/$0.10, but can go as high as $25/$50. For 7-Card Stud, the starting blinds are typically $0.10/$0.20, but can go as high as $10/$20.\n\nThe antes at BGaming also vary depending on the game being played. However, they typically start at around 1% of the big blind amount for each game type. So, for example, in a Texas Hold’em game with a $1/2 blind level, the ante would be $0.02 per hand dealt.\n\n#  How does seating work at BGaming?\n\nBGaming is a new online casino that offers a range of exciting games and great bonuses.

For example, if the pot reaches $45.00 at a capped table, BGaming would charge an additional $0.90 in rake, for a total rake of $1.05.</p>\n<p>Rake is paid out to the winning player at each hand according to the following payout schedule:</p>\n<p>1-2 players: 80% / 20%<br>3-4 players: 60% / 30% / 10%<br>5-6 players: 50% / 30% / 20% / 10%<br>7-8 players: 40% / 30% / 25% / 10%</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-is-the-average-amount-of-hands-you-can-expect-to-play-per-hour\"><a href=\"#What-is-the-average-amount-of-hands-you-can-expect-to-play-per-hour\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What is the average amount of hands you can expect to play per hour?\"></a>What is the average amount of hands you can expect to play per hour?</h1><p>The average number of hands an individual can play per hour varies based on the limits of the game, the aggressiveness of the player, and a variety of other factors. Generally speaking though, most poker players can expect to play around sixty to eighty hands per hour at lower limits and up to one hundred hands per hour at higher limits.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-does-the-number-of-hands-played-vary-based-on-limit\"><a href=\"#How-does-the-number-of-hands-played-vary-based-on-limit\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How does the number of hands played vary based on limit?\"></a>How does the number of hands played vary based on limit?</h1><p>As one might expect, the number of hands that can be played in an hour varies drastically based on the limit being played. At lower levels, where the stakes are smaller, players will typically play fewer hands per hour. This is due primarily to two factors: there is less money on the line per hand and players are typically less aggressive at these limits. Conversely, at higher levels where the stakes are larger, players will often play more hands per hour as they look to maximize their profits. Additionally, many high-stakes games are played “live” with relatively few hands being dealt in comparison to online games.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-does-the-number-of-hands-played-vary-based-on-aggressiveness\"><a href=\"#How-does-the-number-of-hands-played-vary-based-on-aggressiveness\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How does the number of hands played vary based on aggressiveness?\"></a>How does the number of hands played vary based on aggressiveness?</h1><p>The aggressiveness of a player also has a significant impact on how many hands they will play in an hour. More aggressive players will typically play more hands than those who are less aggressive. This is primarily due to the fact that more aggressive players are looking to take control of the table by playing more aggressively themselves and punishing their opponents for making mistakes. Conversely, passive players will usually play fewer hands as they try to minimize their losses and wait for better opportunities.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-are-the-starting-blinds-and-antes-at-BGaming\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-starting-blinds-and-antes-at-BGaming\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the starting blinds and antes at BGaming?\"></a>What are the starting blinds and antes at BGaming?</h1><p>BGaming offers a variety of different poker games with varying blind levels and antes. The starting blinds and antes at BGaming depend on the game being played.</p>\n<p>Some of the most popular BGaming poker games include Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and 7-Card Stud. For Texas Hold’em, the starting blinds are typically $0.10/$0.25, but can go as high as $100/$200. For Omaha, the starting blinds are typically $0.05/$0.10, but can go as high as $25/$50. For 7-Card Stud, the starting blinds are typically $0.10/$0.20, but can go as high as $10/$20.</p>\n<p>The antes at BGaming also vary depending on the game being played. However, they typically start at around 1% of the big blind amount for each game type. So, for example, in a Texas Hold’em game with a $1/2 blind level, the ante would be $0.02 per hand dealt.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-does-seating-work-at-BGaming\"><a href=\"#How-does-seating-work-at-BGaming\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How does seating work at BGaming?\"></a>How does seating work at BGaming?</h1><p>BGaming is a new online casino that offers a range of exciting games and great bonuses.

The name Sic Bo is derived from the Chinese words for “dice” and “to throw”. \n\nThe game is simple to play. Players bet on the result of rolling three dice. The different betting options are: \n-Any Two (pair): A player bets that the two dice showing on top will have the same value. For example, two sixes or two fives. \n-Specific Triplet: A player bets that the three dice will show the same value. For example, all three dice showing sixes or all three dice showing ones. \n-Small (1-4): A player bets that the total value of the three dice will be less than 12. \n-Big (5-9): A player bets that the total value of the three dice will be greater than 12. \n-Even: A player bets that the total value of the three dice will be even. \n-Odd: A player bets that the total value of the three dice will be odd.\n\n#  What do you need to play Sic Bo? \n\nSic Bo, also known as DICE BOARD, is a casino game that uses three dice. To play Sic Bo, you will need a Sic Bo table and three dice. The bettors place their bets on the various boxes available on the Sic Bo table. \n\nThe dealer will shake the dice in a cup and then roll them onto the table. The result of the roll is read from the different combinations of numbers shown on the dice. Some of the most common winning combinations are: three of a kind, a straight (6 consecutive numbers), a four of a kind, or a full house (3 of one number and 2 of another). \n\nThe payout odds for each bet vary depending on the probability of that particular bet winning. For example, betting on a single number pays out at odds of 36 to 1, while betting on two numbers pays out at 9 to 1.\n\n#  Who created Sic Bo? \n\nSic Bo is an ancient Chinese game that is still played today. The name Sic Bo means “dice pair” in Chinese. The game was mentioned in the 3rd century BC text, the Book of Songs. The game was brought to Vietnam in the 8th century, and then to Europe by the Dutch in the 17th Century.\n\nThere are many theories about who invented Sic Bo, but the most probable theory is that it was developed by soldiers during the Warring States Period (476 BC-221 BC). The soldiers would use dice to gamble on whether they would survive the next battle.\n\nThe popularity of Sic Bo grew during the 18th and 19th centuries as it spread throughout Asia and Europe. In Asia, Sic Bo is considered a popular casino game, while in Europe it is considered a dice game for gambling enthusiasts.\n\n#  What countries can play Sic Bo? \n\nSic Bo, also known as “dice game” is a popular casino game that originated from China. The game is played with three dice and the player can bet on the different combinations of the dice. \n\nThe game is available in many countries, including the United States, Macau and Australia. However, not all countries allow players to gamble on Sic Bo. For example, the United Kingdom does not permit gambling on this game. \n\nThere are a few other restrictions on who can play Sic Bo. For example, players must be at least 18 years old in most jurisdictions in order to play the game.\n\n#  What are the odds in Sic Bo?\n\nIf you are looking to gamble and want to explore some new games, Sic Bo may be the perfect option for you. This ancient Chinese game is relatively simple to play, but offers plenty of excitement and potential profits. So what are the odds in Sic Bo?\n\nWhen playing Sic Bo, there are three dice involved. Each die has a different number of spots on it, ranging from one to six. Before the dice are rolled, players place bets on what they believe the combination will be. There are many different combinations that could come up, and the odds change with each bet.\n\nThe simplest bet is guessing which number will come up on any one of the three dice. This pays out at odds of 3:1 if you guess correctly. There are also bets that involve two numbers being matched, or all three numbers matching. The odds for these bets vary, but can be as high as 180:1.\n\nGenerally speaking, the odds in Sic Bo are quite favourable for players. With a little bit of luck, it is possible to win big payouts from this exciting game.","source":"_posts/What-is-Sic-Bo-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is Sic Bo \ndate: 2022-09-28 15:05:32\ncategories:\n- Starvegas\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is Sic Bo? \n\nSic Bo is a casino game that uses three dice.

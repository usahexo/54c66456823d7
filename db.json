sympathy, identification, evaluation, division, opposition, and communion. \nEach one of these helps to create meaning in literature and support the main theme. Let's discuss each one in more detail. \n\nSympathy is when the reader feels pity or concern for the characters in a work. Identification is when the reader blurry the lines between themselves and the character in order to understand them better. Evaluation is judgment rendered by the reader about the worth of a particular character or action. Division is analyzing a text into smaller pieces in order to understand it better. Opposition is looking at different sides of an argument to gain a deeper understanding. And communion is when the reader connects with the work on a personal level. \n\nAll of these help to create a well-rounded reading experience that allows readers to connect with literature on different levels.
